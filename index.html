            <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
            <p>Hi, I'm a 12th grader on the Autism Spectrum. I have milder form of ASD. This is what was formally known
                as Asperger syndrome. I generally lead a normal life, though I do have some trouble with social
                connections and have some other idiosyncracies. I usually feel as if I am an actor in a play. However, I
                do well in school and am attending college next year.</p>
            <p>This site serves to find some ASD resources and serve as a guide for individuals looking to find more
                information on mild ASD and its impact on life and school.</p>

                <h4>What is Asperger Syndrome?</h4>
                <p>According to the Autism Society, Asperger syndrome was renamed under the umbrella of Autism Spectrum
                    Disorder in 2013. This diagnosis is different from other types of autism because “Children with
                    autism are frequently viewed as aloof and uninterested in others. This is not the case with
                    Asperger’s Disorder. Individuals with Asperger’s Disorder usually want to fit in and have
                    interaction with others, but often they don’t know how to do it.”</p>
                <p>Children with this type of Autism Spectrum Disorder tend to struggle with social interactions,
                    hypersensitivity, and struggle with change. Children with this disability also have multiple
                    strengths like very good focus, attention to detail, and pattern recognition.</p>
                <p>This condition has been referred to as “high functioning autism” due to the average to above-average
                    intelligence of children with the disability, as well as no delay in language. In fact, in order to
                    be diagnosed with this disability, you must “have normal language development as well as normal
                    intelligence.”</p>

                <h4>How is ASD Diagnosed?</h4>
                <p>It is typically diagnosed either medically or educationally. A physician can make an assessment based
                    on symptoms and diagnostic tests according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5, released
                    2013) of the American Psychological Association. It can also be diagnosed educationally by a
                    multidisciplinary evaluation team of various school professionals.</p>

                <h4>Statistics on ASD</h4>
                <p>There is no known single cause for autism spectrum disorder, but it is generally accepted that it is
                    caused by abnormalities in brain structure or function.</p>
                <ul class="statistics">
                    <li>About 1 percent of the world population has autism spectrum disorder.</li>

                        in 68).</li>
                    <li>Autism is the fastest-growing developmental disability
