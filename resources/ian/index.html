        <p>IAN provides a series of articles about ASD. This article highlights an under-researched topic in ASD research. However, romantic relationships are a significant impairment for those with ASD.</p>
        <h3>Summary of article (created with <a href="https://www.summarizebot.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SummarizeBot</a>)</h3>
        <p>While a young adult with classic autism may appear content with a solitary &quot;monastic&quot; lifestyle,
            this is often not the case with young adults who have Asperger's syndrome or high-functioning autism.</p>
        <p>Clinical experience has identified that the majority of such adolescents and young adults would like a
            romantic relationship.</p>
        <p>However, there is remarkably little research examining this aspect of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) or
            strategies to facilitate successful relationships.</p>
        <p>We know that young adults with Asperger's syndrome have significant difficulty developing peer relationships
            and are developmentally delayed in knowing what someone may be thinking or feeling.</p>
        <p>Young adults with a diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome or high-functioning autism also have conspicuously
            limited social conversational skills or ability to communicate emotions, especially affection.</p>
        <p>Local Asperger's syndrome support groups for parents have established support groups for young adults with
            Asperger's syndrome.</p>
        <p>Some adults with Asperger's syndrome have used the Internet and dating agencies to meet people, but this
            method of introduction also can be used by relationship predators, and an adult with Asperger's syndrome
            needs to be aware of the many risks associated with using this strategy.</p>
        <p>Some adults with Asperger's syndrome also have decided not to seek an intimate relationship with someone for
            legitimate reasons when one considers the characteristics of Asperger's syndrome.</p>
        <p>However, there needs to be more research, and the Interactive Autism Network database may be extremely useful
            in providing information on romantic relationships for adolescents and young adults with Asperger's syndrome
            and high-functioning autism.</p>

        <h3>Critique of the source</h3>
        <h4>Strengths</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Approaches an under-researched aspect of ASD.</li>
            <li>Highlights how those with ASD can have normal, functioning romantic relationships.</li>
            <li>Provides suggestions on how to improve relationship skills.</li>
            <li>Examines some relationship impairments for those with ASD, such as missing queues, being sexually
                inappropriate, and inability to progress to full partnership.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Pre-DSM-5, so it may be outdated, especially in the transition from Asperger Syndrome to the aggregate
                ASD.</li>
            <li>No formality to the discussion of the disability</li>
            <li>Unverifiable accounts of having ASD</li>
        </ul>
