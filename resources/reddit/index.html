        <p>Reddit has become a very popular website for people to connect with each other and discuss different topics
            in the world. As a high school student, websites like Reddit are becoming very prominent in everyday life
            due to the easy communication and layout. The current thread is an archived one that allows people with
            autism in the Reddit community to share with each other their thoughts and comment on each others stories.
            It can be a powerful bonding place where social interactions can be practiced and all questions can be
            answered.</p>
