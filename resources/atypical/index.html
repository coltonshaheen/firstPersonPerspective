        </h2>
        <p>Atypical is a Netflix show about a boy named Sam with Autism Spectrum Disorder and tells the story of the his high school experience. The show covers many different aspects about what itâ€™s like to be an adolescent with ASD from family interactions, support programs, and the everyday social interactions. Although it is dramatized, it could be comforting to see a character, that you can identify with, navigate their high school life. People with disabilities rarely get highlighted in movies or television, except maybe as a supporting character.</p>

        <h3>Critique of the source</h3>
        <h4>Strengths</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The show highlights different scenarios that are common to someone with ASD, and even goes on to show productive ways to navigate challenges faced.</li>
            <li>Being able to identify with a main character in a television show is a boost in self-confidence</li>
            <li>Having people without ASD get exposed to it will allow them to understand the disability more</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Overdramazitation of events in the show can make the disability seem more severe than in most cases</li>
            <li>There is no interaction or place for discussion</li>
            <li>Might make someone with ASD get unwanted attention from people who have seen the show</li>
        </ul>
