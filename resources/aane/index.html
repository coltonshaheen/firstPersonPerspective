        </h2>
        <p>AANE is a semi-official ASD website, organized by parents and professionals. While initially oriented toward Asperger syndrome, after the diagnostic change in 2013 they rebranded and reoriented toward all individuals on the spectrum. AANE is inclusive and does not require a diagnosis to engage in events and services. It also serves parents, families, and professionals in understanding life with ASD.</p>

        <h3>Critique of the source</h3>
        <h4>Strengths</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Provides formal and informal events for members of the ASD community.</li>
            <li>Creates a bond with others who have the same disabilities</li>
            <li>Easy access and navigation.</li>
            <li>Substitues Asperger Profile for Asperger Syndrome as definition of those with mild forms of ASD.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A membership fee is required to attend events and access other resources and the network. While the fee is relatively small, this could be a barrier to some people.</li>
            <li>Takes a somewhat clinical approach to ASD.</li>
            <li>Could be overwhelmingly large and broad for people seeking resources and connections.</li>
        </ul>
